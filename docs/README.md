## üîç Key Concepts Explained

### Customer Segmentation
The system uses **K-means clustering** to automatically group customers based on:
- Total spending amount
- Purchase frequency
- Customer age
- Purchase recency

This creates actionable segments like "High Value," "Medium Value," and "Low Value" customers for targeted marketing.

### Predictive Analytics
Three main prediction models:

1. **Churn Prediction**: Identifies customers likely to stop purchasing
2. **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Estimates total customer value over time
3. **Next Purchase**: Predicts when customers will buy again

### Campaign Optimization
AI-powered recommendations to improve marketing performance:
- **ROAS Optimization**: Maximize return on advertising spend
- **Cost Minimization**: Reduce campaign costs while maintaining performance
- **Conversion Maximization**: Increase conversion rates and customer acquisition

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Highlights

### Backend (Go)
- **Framework**: Gin for high-performance HTTP routing
- **Database**: MongoDB with optimized indexes
- **AI/ML**: Custom algorithms with GoLearn integration
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with separation of concerns

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **UI**: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Zustand for global state management
- **Data**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization

### Database Design
- **Collections**: Customers, Purchases, Campaigns, Segments, Predictions
- **Relationships**: Properly normalized with foreign key references
- **Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Aggregation**: MongoDB pipelines for complex analytics
